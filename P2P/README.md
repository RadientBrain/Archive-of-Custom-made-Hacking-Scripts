## P2P text, audio or video geolocator for the other user

> Just run the script into the console of a browser and see the results whenever you text, talk or video call any other person on a P2P connection.<br><br>
> As this script is asynchornously called on every new fetch of data from the other side so it will always give the result of your current target.

### Measures to prevent such leak of privacy
- Use a VPN and try to avoid using P2P connections
- Try to use proxy chains if possible
